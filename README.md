Simple CRUD habit tracker, not completed yet and I plan to eventually redo this into a full site. I was inspired to do this based on the wall calender in my office that I put small stickers on each day to track my daily habits. I tried to implement some guidelines from a guide off Scotch.io that I encountered last week as well, so credit goes there for helping me learn some better refactoring patterns.
